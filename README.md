# Public attitude towards COVID-19 lockdown(A twitter sentiment analysis study)
## Method of research
The machine learning algorithms of Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) and Grid Search Cross Validation (GridSearch CV) are implemented to configure and to optimize the classifier for comparing two groups of March coronavirus tweets datasets on Twitter.
## Datasets
This study identified the emotional variations before and after the policy of lockdown to avoid the coronavirus spread. There are three groups of the datasets performed in the model. One is expected to the labeled dataset to train a classifier for identifying positive and negative tweets and the other two collected coronavirus datasets are set in the high-performance model to obtain the probabilities of negative and positive after preprocessing the raw datasets. 
All of datasets in this study derive from the one of the biggest dataset platforms, Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140. 
## Results 
- The final accuracy of the model is approximately 90%.
- Experimental results demonstrated that psychological variations of public have not changed noticeably on Twitter in March. 
## Limitation
The study is based on two days of tweets data, the number of dates implemented in the study is possibly so small that the influence results of lockdown are not noticeable. Although the number of tweets joined in the classifier is probably not enough large, the neutral attitude of tweets occupied the most of tweets. Therefore, the selection of dataset maybe had several problems due to the beginning of this study is on March 30.
